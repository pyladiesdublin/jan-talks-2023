## Talk 2: Update Nested Serializers Fields with Django REST Framework by Uffa Modey
While building web API endpoints for CRUDing (creating, retrieving, updating and deleting) data objects in a database using Django REST framework, you will realise that the object fields related to other objects in the database are not CRUDed by default üò∞ . They have to be serialized appropriately üí™.
In this talk, we will showcase how data for an employee data management app that stores information (employee id, first name, last name, employment date and certifications) on every employee on the app is CRUDed in the app database. Since every employee, may possess one or more certifications (or even no certifications) we will use a Many-to-One relationship (also known as a foreign key relationship) to map every employee to their certifications in the database.
This talk is a beginner-friendly technical demonstration. Full details for recreating the app will be shared.

She is passionate about capacity building for underrepresented communities (predominantly women and youth) to enable them to access the resources they require to become technology industry leaders globally and ultimately bridge inequalities in ICT.
